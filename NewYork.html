        <p><b>Here's a little information about my trip to New York!</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>I visit New York during the COVID-19 panademic of 2020. When visiting New York due to the 
            pandemic, I was able to experience Time Square empty. I wanted to share my trip to New York
            because not to many people in our world today would be able to say that they have experienced New Yorkthe way I did.
            New York was fun and I can say that I will be return to experience it differently. But I hope you enjoy the pictures that I have for you!</p>
